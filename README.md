# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project uses deep learning (CNN + LSTM) to detect heart disease from echocardiographic videos. It classifies videos as Normal or Diseased by analyzing spatial and temporal features. A Streamlit web app allows real-time video upload and prediction, enabling early, automated diagnosis.
